# Jira Personal Access Tokens
# ============================
# Authentication tokens for each Jira host.
#
# SETUP:
#   1. Copy this file to .tokens.yaml
#   2. Generate a PAT for each host you need
#   3. Replace YOUR_PAT_TOKEN_HERE with your actual tokens
#
# SECURITY:
#   - .tokens.yaml is gitignored - NEVER commit it
#   - PATs should have minimum required permissions
#   - Rotate tokens periodically
#
# GENERATING A PAT:
#   1. Log into your Jira instance
#   2. Go to Profile → Personal Access Tokens
#   3. Click "Create token"
#   4. Name it (e.g., "jira-cli")
#   5. Copy the token immediately (shown only once)
#
# REQUIRED PERMISSIONS:
#   - Browse projects
#   - Create issues (for jira batch)
#   - Edit issues (for jira apply)
#   - Add comments (for jira apply)
#   - Transition issues (for status changes)

hosts:
  # Main Jira instance
  company:
    token: YOUR_PAT_TOKEN_HERE

  # Additional instances (add as needed)
